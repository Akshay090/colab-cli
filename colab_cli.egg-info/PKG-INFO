        > Experience better workflow with google colab, local jupyter notebooks and git
        
        ### ✨ [Demo](https://github.com/Akshay090/colab-cli/demo)
        
        ## Install
        
        ```sh
        python -m pip install colab-cli or python3.7 -m pip install colab-cli
        ```
        ## Set-up
        
        STEP-1: 
         
         Get your client_secrets.json, [instructions given here](https://pythonhosted.org/PyDrive/quickstart.html),
        only follow till the part where you have client_secrets.json in a local directory
        
        STEP-2: 
        
         Go to the local directory with client_secrets.json
          ```sh
          colab-cli set-config client_secrets.json
          ```
        STEP-3:
         
        Now we need to set the google account user id, goto your browser and see how many google logins you have,
         the count start from zero
         
         for eg. I have 3 login and I use the second one for coding work, so my user id is 1
          ```sh
          colab-cli set-auth-user 1
          ```
         
        🙌 Now You're all set to go
        ## Usage
        
        ```sh
        colab-cli --help
        ```
        * List local ipynb
        ```sh
        colab-cli list-nb
        ``` 
        * Open local ipynb file in google colab for first time and remote copy for subsequent time
        ```sh
        colab-cli open-nb lesson1-pets.ipynb
        ``` 
        * Now you have made some changes to ipynb in colab, get the modified file locally by
        ```sh
        colab-cli pull-nb lesson1-pets.ipynb
        ``` 
        * Made some changes to ipynb locally, push it to drive
        ```sh
        colab-cli push-nb lesson1-pets.ipynb
        ```
